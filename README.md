# WEBIFY

Web project made to display front-end web development skills.

Webify is a spotify playlist generator / updater. Once you login to your spotify account, you will be taken to the main page, where you can select the playlist you want to regenerate / update or create a new one. Once you have selected a playlist with the left side container, the left side container contains a couple widgets that allow you to set your preferences when generating a playlist.

All changes made to a playlist (including playlist creation) are reflected instantly both in Spotify and Webify.

### Widgets

* Genre Widget

* Decades Widget
Lets you filter any songs that might be added from the previous widgets so that only the ones released in certain decades are included.

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
